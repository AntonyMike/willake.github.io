                <p class="article-content">
                    Recently I've joined a book club which I found on the social media (PTT), this book club was hold every Sunday. After I've joined the book club, I learned lots of new techniques that I used to ignore or I never knew; therefore, I would like to share what I’ve learned from there. The things that I am going to share are some techniques that I'd never notice, so I won't explain everything from the beginning. And for those that think these techniques are too easy and was written on the book, please forgive me for my ignorance because I wrote this in order to remind myself of some key points.
                    </p>
                <h3>Foreword</h3>
                <p class="article-content">
                     C# is the first programming language that I learned. Actually, in the first semester of my college I used to have learned C and C++; however, I failed the class due to my lack of concentration in class. In the second semester, I decided to learn programming language seriously. At that time, there is a course call Windows Programming and the course is all about C#. During the class, I designed a tower defense game by using C# only. It was a special memory for me and I think there are lots of things that I can improve in order to make the game better. (If I have the time to redo it again lol)<br>
               </p>
               <p class="article-content">
                     The main purpose that I joined the book club is to study more about programming. Also, most of the member of the book club are non-student. I can learn some techniques of cooperate development, how to improve efficacy and know what’s going on in industry. The book club was divided into two groups, one group study advanced C# and the other study ASP.NET MVC. These two groups will assign weekly homework and on every Sunday both groups will come up with a person that’s going to share some key points and techniques that is important in the homework. I’ll explain what’s MVC in my next review, when I have a full understand of it.
                </p>
                <h3>What I've learn from book club</h3>
                <p class="article-content">
                    This week’s book club we were talking about Type declaration, basically I have had some understand about basic types, such as int, float, string etc. And most of them are all about the “string”.
                </p>
                <h4>Verbatim string literals</h4>
                <p class="article-content">
                    Some people might need to store a path of a file in to a string while they are using C#; however, we can’t use ‘\’in a string because it will be seen as an escape character. Escape character are something like “\n” (end line) “\t” (tab). Today we assume that we have a file name “Lion.jpg” in a file name “Willake” in local disk-D, and we want to store its path in to a string. Then, we declare the string like this:
                </p>
               <pre class="prettyprint linenums">string path = "D:\Willake\Lion.jpg";</pre>
               <p class="article-content">
                   The compiler will tell you that there is an error, so we have to declare it like this:
               </p>
               <pre class="prettyprint linenums">string path = "D:\\Willake\\Lion.jpg";</pre>
               <p class="article-content">
                   Its quite bother to add an extra ‘\’ to every ‘\’, but actually we just need to add a ‘@’ in front of the quotation mark and it will be fine. Though you still have to write it in the other way if you really need to use “\n”.
               </p>
               <pre class="prettyprint linenums">string path = @"D:\Willake\Lion.jpg";</pre>
               <p class="article-content">
                    Because all the escape characters will be seen as normal character in this method, if you are going to put some words or SQL or even javascript code in to a string, you might need to use a lot of ‘+’ and ‘&’ . This way may cause low efficacy, but if you use ‘@’ it will be much more simple.
               </p>
               <h4>Use ‘+’ to concatenate multiple strings will waste the memory space.</h4>
               <p class="article-content">
                   We usually face the problem of concatenating multiple strings while we using C#, and what we do is adding a ‘+’ between strings.
               </p>
               <pre class="prettyprint linenums">string msg = "Hello,",Name = "Peter";
msg += Name;
msg += ". Today is ";
msg += System.DateTime.Today.ToShortDateString();</pre>
               <p class="article-content">
                   When we use that method, you may think it will be like this in the memory:
               </p>
               <img src="/img/article/cs-0605/string-plus.png" style="width:500px;">
               <p class="article-content">
                   Stored the data in the original location of the string. Actually, it will be like this:
               </p>
               <img src="/img/article/cs-0605/string-plus2.png" style="width:400px;">
               <p class="article-content">
                   Every time we use ‘+’ to concatenating strings, the memory will assign a new space to store the string. The original string won't be deleted and will become a trash.
                   It is because CLR wants to save the memory space so it build a hash table system
                    in heap. Relative to string, StringBuilder class is better. It is changeable so it won't assign any new space. we can use it to concatenate strings.
               </p>
               <pre class="prettyprint linenums">string name = "Peter";
StringBuilder msg = new StringBuilder("Hello, ");
msg.Append(name);
msg.Append(". Today is ");
msg.Append(DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString());
string finalMsg = msg.ToString();</pre>
            <h4>C# 6.0 Interpolated Strings</h4>
            <p class="article-content">
                  We used to use String.Format() function to converts the value of objects to strings  and inserts them into another.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">string firstName = "Willake";
string lastName = "Lin";
int salary = 80000;

string msg1 = String.Format("{0} {1} 's salary is {2:C0} per month.", firstName, lastName, salary);</pre>
            <p class="article-content">
                  In C# 6.0, Microsoft add a new feature called “Interpolated Strings”. You can add a
                  ‘$’ before the string.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">string firstName = "Willake";
string lastName = "Lin";
int salary = 80000;

string msg1 = $"{firstName} {lastName} 's salary is {salary :C0} per month.";</pre>
           <p class="article-content">
                  Both of results will display "Willake Lin 's salary is NT$80000 per month.". If there are lots of variables that need to be insert into a string, using string.format() isnt that convenient because you need to compare against each other and that is a huge task.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="article-content">
                  This is what I learned from the study group on June 5. Everyone in the group is nice, they won't alienate people who is just a beginner. I'm really looking forward
                  to next gathering, hoping i can learn more interesting things.
